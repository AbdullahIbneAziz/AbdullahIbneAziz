### About

I solve real-world problems with machine learning and data analysis, blending Python skills with clear communication. Recent work spans student performance modeling, behavior risk prediction, and small-business sales analytics.

When I'm not immersed in data, I enjoy creative writing and exploring new ways to tell stories through numbers and insights.
